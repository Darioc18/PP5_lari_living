## Design
In the CSS file, variables are used to keep color definitions consistent across the entire stylesheet. This approach simplifies color updates throughout the website by adjusting the color once in the variable, maintaining design uniformity.

Attention is also given to ensuring a clear contrast between background colors and text at all times, improving user accessibility.
### Colour Scheme
The design is clean and utilizes three neutral colors strategically to draw attention to the color and forms of the products.
Colour palette from [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)
![Colour Palette](documentation/readme_images/design/colour_palette.png)

 ### Imagery
 A minimalist hero image was chosen to convey a sense of elegance and luxury, without overwhelming the viewer. The simplicity of the design allows the focus to remain on the features of the website enhancing the general visual appeal.

### Logo

The logo is designed with sinuous lines that evoke the image of a figure reclining comfortably. Placing the name of the brand atop the design, adds to its sophistication while ensuring clarity and brand recognition. This logo design captures the essence of Lari Living's ethos, subtly communicating luxury and comfort.

![Logo Design](documentation/readme_images/design/logo_design.jpg)

### Favicon

A favicon was designed to appear in the browser tab. It incorporates the logo within a circular shape with inverted colors, and the initials of the store's name are positioned on top.

![Favicon](documentation/readme_images/design/favicon.png)

### Typography
The chosen font, used throughout the website, brings a modern and vibrant feel to the brand's image, without being too rigid and adding to its contemporary appeal: [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) Google font.

## Agile Methodology

Agile methodology is an iterative and flexible approach to project management and software development that prioritizes adaptability, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It emphasizes incremental progress, continuous feedback, and the ability to respond to changing requirements throughout the development process.

Principles of agile methodology have been used during the website development, incorporating the following key aspects:

### GitHub Projects/Kanban Board

GitHub Projects was used to manage the development process following an agile methodology. The project board, accessible through this [link](https://github.com/users/Darioc18/projects/4/views/1?layout=board), served as a practical tool for organizing tasks and tracking progress.

The Epics were documented within the GitHub project as Milestones. A Github Issue template was create to facilitate adding User Stories to the kanban board. For each User Story, a GitHub Issue was created and allocated to a milestone (Epic).

### MoSCoW Prioritization

The MOSCOW method was employed for task prioritization, categorizing them into Must-haves, Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves. This systematic prioritization ensured a focused and flexible development process.

<summary>MoSCoW & GitHub Kanban</summary>

![MoSCoW & GitHub Kanban](documentation/readme_images/features/kanban_board.jpg)
</details>

## Database Diagram

The data model for Lari Living follows Object-Oriented Programming principles. SQLite was used as database during development, while Postgres was chosen for the Heroku-deployed version.

### ERD

An entity relationship diagram (ERD) was created using Lucidchart to visualize the relationships between different entities within the database:

![ERD](documentation/readme_images/features/erd.jpg)

[Back to Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Defensive Design

### Form Validation:

Comprehensive form validation mechanisms have been implemented. In the event of incorrect or empty data during form submission, the form blocks the submission and displays a user-friendly warning. This approach ensures users promptly receive feedback about the specific fields causing errors.

### User Authentication

In instances where Django's Class-based-views are utilized, the LoginRequiredMixin is implemented to make sure that requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated users are redirected to the login page.

For function-based views, Django's *login_required* decorator is utilized to restrict access as necessary. These decorators ensure that only authenticated users are able to access certain functionalities, and that access is further limited based on specific conditions or permissions.

To restrict access to non-authorized users, the following code snippet is used in certain instances:
```
if not request.user.is_superuser:
        messages.error(request, 'Sorry, only store owners can do that.')
        return redirect(reverse('home'))
```
### Custom Error Page

Custom error page 404 and 500 were created to give the user more information on the error and to provide them with buttons to guide them back to the site.

<details>
<summary>Error 404 page</summary>

![Error 404 page](documentation/readme_images/features/error_404.JPG)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Error 500 page</summary>

![Error 500 page](documentation/readme_images/features/error_500.JPG)
</details>

### Database Protection:

Prioritizing confidentiality and safeguarding against unauthorized access, my database security approach involves storing the database URL and secret key in a separate *env-py* file. This precautionary measure was established before the initial push to GitHub, preserving the confidentiality of sensitive information.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:

The website employs CSRF tokens on all forms across the site, adding an extra layer of defense against cross-site request forgery attacks.

In the mobile header the navigation bar is contained within a hamburger menu and the search bar is reduced to an icon as the profile and bag icons, optimizing space and maintaining a clean layout. These design choices adhere to the principles of responsive design, for optimal user experience across various devices.

![Mobile Header](documentation/readme_images/features/mobile_navbar.jpg)

Clicking on all external links opens the respective website in another tab, preventing users from being redirected away from the site.

#### Footer on Mobile Screens

On mobile devices, the footer is structured in a single column format, containing the same elements as on desktop. The logo of the website is included to provide users with a quick way to return to the homepage from any page they're on. This choice improve ease of navigation across different screen sizes.

![Mobile Footer](documentation/readme_images/features/mobile_footer.jpg)

### Home Page

The home page features a prominent call-to-action section designed to encourage user engagement. Users are invited to either *Shop Now* or *Contact* the store. This section aims to capture the attention of visitors and prompt them to take action.

![Home Page](documentation/readme_images/features/homepage.jpg)

### User Account Pages

Django Allauth was implemented to facilitate the Sign up, Log in, and Log out functionalities on the website. Success messages are displayed to inform users about their successful login or logout actions.

During the Sign up process, users are required to verify their email address by clicking on the authentication link sent to the provided email address.

In case a user forgets their password, they can use a password reset functionality by clicking on the *Forgot Password?* option on the login page. This functionality enables users to regain access to their accounts securely.

All the allauth default templates have been styled to match the general design of the website by using both Bootstrap and CSS.

The delivery details section serves as a section for storing the user's delivery address and phone number. This information is utilized to autofill the delivery address field during the order placement process, streamlining the checkout experience for users.

Under *My Profile* page, the order history section is included. It presents users with a list of every order they have placed on the website. Within this section, a table is displayed showcasing key details including the order number, date of purchase, and the total amount spent. Users can conveniently navigate through their order history by clicking on the order number, which redirects them to a summary page providing detailed information about the selected order. This functionality allows users to easily track and review their past purchases.

Upon clicking on a past order, the order details are listed, and a toast message notifies the user that the order is from a previous transaction. This feature ensures clarity for users, informing them about the status of their order and helping them navigate through their purchase history.

### Product Detail

![Product Details](documentation/readme_images/features/product_detail_page.jpg)

When the user clicks on an individual product card, they are directed to the full product details page.

The product detail page showcases the product image, title, price, and product details. If the user is a superuser, edit and delete buttons appear below these details, providing convenient management options.

Situated underneath the product details, the quantity buttons are used to add items to the bag. The plus and minus buttons increase and decrease the input value, respectively. The minus quantity button is disabled when the value is set to 1, and the plus button is disabled when a site user tries to purchase more than 15 units.
If the user manually inputs a negative number or a number exceeding 99 and clicks "Add to Bag", an error message will appear, informing the user of the required parameters for successful submission.

Two buttons at the bottom invite the user to add the item to the bag or to go back to the product section to continue shopping.

### Product Management

#### Add Product

![Add Product Page](documentation/readme_images/features/add_product.jpg)

The add product page is accessible by clicking in the user dropdown menu *Product Management*. These option is exclusively visible to superusers.

In case a non-superuser attempts to access the add product page (e.g., by changing the URL), they receive an error message.

To successfully submit the add product form, users must fill out all fields marked with an asterisk. If any required fields are left blank or contain only whitespace upon submission, an error message appears above the respective field, alerting the user to the issue.

Additionally, if a price with more than 6 digits is entered, the form submission fails, and an error message appears under the price field.

Users have the option to upload a photo of the product. If no photo is uploaded, a default image is displayed as the product image.

Upon clicking the 'Add Product' button at the bottom of the form, the product is created, provided there are no errors on the form. Users receive a success message notifying them that the product has been successfully added.

#### Edit Product

![Edit Product Page](documentation/readme_images/features/edit_product.jpg)

Superusers have the option to edit a product by clicking the edit button on the product card or on the product detail page. Upon clicking, the form opens with all fields populated with the original content.

The image field displays a thumbnail of the existing image and includes a checkbox option to remove it. If checked, the image is changed to the default image.

In case a non-superuser attempts to access the edit product page (e.g., by changing the URL), an error message is displayed notifying that only the superuser can access this function.

Upon successful update of the product, the superuser receives a success message notifying them that the product has been successfully updated.

#### Delete Product

![Delete Product Page](documentation/readme_images/features/delete_product.jpg)

Superusers have the option to delete a product by clicking the delete button on the product card or on the product detail page. Upon clicking, the superuser is prompted to confirm if they wish to delete the product or cancel the action.

After confirming the deletion, the superuser receives a success message notifying them that the product has been successfully deleted. This confirmation message provides reassurance and confirmation of the action taken.

### Bag

![Bag Page](documentation/readme_images/features/bag_page.jpg)

When the user clicks on the shopping bag icon in the navbar, they are directed to the shopping bag page, where they can view the products they have added to their cart. The page displays each product's name, unit price, quantity, and subtotal.

The quantity input box indicates the quantity of the product added to the bag. Plus and minus buttons allow users to increase and decrease the input value, respectively.

Clicking the *Update* icon button saves any changes to the quantity and updates the item's subtotal. Clicking the *Remove* button removes the item completely from the user's bag. If the user manually inputs a negative number and clicks *Update*, the item is removed from the bag.

At the end of the line items, a summary of the costs is provided. The summary includes the bag's total, delivery cost, and the grand total to pay. Beneath the grand total, users find a message informing them of how much more they need to spend to receive free delivery if they haven't already met the free delivery threshold set to ‚Ç¨1500. Two buttons are provided beneath the grand total. From here, users can either continue to the checkout or return to the products page by clicking *Keep Shopping*.

### Checkout

![Checkout Page](documentation/readme_images/features/checkout_page.jpg)

#### Details:

Within the details section, users can fill out their contact details, delivery address, and card number. If the user is a guest, a link to create an account or login will be present. For signed-in users, a checkbox to save the delivery information can be checked. If the user is signed in and has delivery information saved, the details and email address will be automatically filled in. Error messages prompt the user to *Fill in the field* or *match the format requested* if they leave a required field empty, input whitespace in a required field, or include text in the phone number field.

#### Order Summary:

The order summary section provides a detailed overview of all items about to be purchased, including the quantity, subtotal, and grand total. Next to the order summary title is a number reflecting the total number of items in the order. Clicking the product image in the summary takes the user to that product's detail page.

#### Payment:

Card payment is securely handled by Stripe. Incorrect card numbers automatically prompt an invalid card number error. A loading screen appears during payment processing to prevent users from clicking away. A warning message at the bottom of the page informs the user of the amount their card is about to be charged. If the payment form doesn't submit properly or the user closes the browser during the wait animation, the order is still created in the database through the webhook. Once payment is processed, the webhook searches the database to confirm the order exists. If it cannot find it, it creates one using the payment information.

#### Confirmation:

Once the order is processed, the user is redirected to the checkout success page, summarizing the completed order. An email with the order confirmation is sent to the user. At the end of the summary is a *Keep Shopping* button, which takes the user back to the products page.

![Order Confirmation](documentation/readme_images/features/order_confirmation.jpg)

### Testimonials

![Testimonials Page](documentation/readme_images/features/testimonials_page.jpg)

A section for users to leave a testimonial has been included.
The page is accessible by clicking the link in the navbar. Upon navigation to the Testimonials page, users can view all testimonials left by previous clients. Each testimonial displays the date, and the user's name.

Users have the capability to edit and delete their own testimonials. To prevent spam on the page, users are restricted to adding only one testimonial.
The superuser possesses the authority to edit or delete testimonials to moderate this section effectively. This setup ensures the integrity and quality of testimonials displayed on the page.

#### Add Testimonial

When a logged-in user clicks on the *Share Your Experience* button on the Testimonials page, they encounter a user-friendly form where they can add a new testimonial to the site. If the user is not logged in, the button is not displayed. This ensures that only logged-in users can access the functionality to add testimonials, maintaining security and preventing unauthorized submissions.

## Deployment

Before deploying the application on Heroku, it is essential to update the requirements.txt file. This file contains a list of requirements necessary for the application to function.
To generate the list of requirements, the command ```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt``` is used. Subsequently, the changes are committed and pushed to GitHub.
Before pushing code to GitHub, it is crucial to ensure that all the sensitive credentials are stored in an env.py file, which is included in the .gitignore file. This instructs Git not to track this file, preventing it from being added to GitHub.

### Deployment on Heroku
- Navigate to the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) dashboard, create a new app with a unique name and select a region.
- Install Gunicorn, a production-ready webserver for Heroku. Add gunicorn to the requirements.txt file.
- Navigate to the "Deploy" section in the navigation bar. Under *Deployment Method*, connect to GitHub by selecting the repository name.
- Create a file named Procfile at the root directory of the project (same directory as requirements.txt).
- In the Procfile, declare this is a web process followed by the command to execute your Django project: ```web: gunicorn my_project.wsgi```, where ```my_project``` is the name of the application, in this case *lari_living*.
- Open the my_project/settings.py file and replace DEBUG=True with DEBUG=False.
- In settings.py append the Heroku hostname to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list.
- On Heroku click on the Deploy tab.
- Set up the database on [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com)
- Modify settings.py file to retrieve the new sensitive credentials from the environment variables; e.g. ```SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")```
- Navigate to the settings tab, then scroll down to Config Vars. Any files that should be hidden, such as credentials and API keys, should be included here. Credentials to keep safe for this project are:
1. Django's secret key
2. Database URL
3. AWS access key
3. AWS secret key
4. Email host password
5. Stripe public key
6. stripe secret key
7. Stripe wh secret
- Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and either click Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deploys or Deploy Branch to deploy manually. Manually deployed branches will need re-deploying each time the repo is updated.
- Click *View* to view the deployed site.


### Connect the Postgres Database
   - This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.
   - Sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:
     - Click *Create New Instance* to start a new database.
