In the CSS file, variables were used to keep color definitions consistent across the entire stylesheet. This approach simplifies color updates throughout the website by adjusting the color once in the variable, maintaining design uniformity.

Attention was also given to ensuring a clear contrast between background colors and text at all times, improving user accessibility.
### Colour Scheme
The design is clean and utilizes three neutral colors strategically to draw attention to the color and forms of the products.

 ### Imagery
 A minimalist hero image was employed to convey a sense of elegance and luxury, without overwhelming the viewer. The simplicity of the design allows the focus to remain on the features of the website enhancing the general visual appeal.

The logo was designed with sinuous lines that evoke the image of a figure reclining comfortably. Placing the name of the brand atop the design adds to its sophistication while ensuring clarity and brand recognition. This logo design captures the essence of Lari Living's ethos, subtly communicating luxury and comfort.
